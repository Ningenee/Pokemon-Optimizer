# Pokemon-Optimizer

Developed a Python program that reads/writes files, takes user input, and returns the most optimal game move. The program manages Pokemon data, including typing, move options, and type effectiveness, using arrays and dictionaries to store and access data. Implemented a 2-D array based on Pokemon Type Charts from Generation 6 onwards. Implemented loops to iterate through the Pokemon roster and moveset, applying game logic to identify the best Pokemon and move combinations for maximum effectiveness in battle.
